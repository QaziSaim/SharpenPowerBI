üìä Power BI Data Model
A Data Model in Power BI is a structured way to organize, connect, and manage all your data tables and relationships. It forms the foundation for performing analysis and building visualizations.

üîç Why Data Modeling is Important
Organizes Data:

Helps structure data properly.

Clearly defines relationships between tables.

Enables Complex Analysis:

Allows combining data from multiple sources.

Helps work with data of different formats and structures.

Improves Performance:

Optimized data models reduce unnecessary calculations.

Enhances report responsiveness.

Drives Better Visualizations:

A well-structured model ensures meaningful and accurate visualizations.

Relationships make it easy to pull relevant data together.

üß© Key Components of a Data Model
Tables (Entities): Represent the data sources and contain fields/columns.

Relationships: Links between tables based on common fields (keys).

Calculations: Include calculated columns and measures used in reports.

‚úÖ Basic Best Practices
Keep the model simple and clean.

Use direct and meaningful relationships (e.g., Sales ‚Üí Customer, Sales ‚Üí Product).

Avoid unnecessary complex joins.

Normalize data where possible to reduce redundancy.

A well-designed model leads to powerful, efficient, and insightful reports.
